# Football-Prediction

Predicting the outcome is a formidable task, given football's inherent unpredictability and its
low level of score that makes it susceptible to momentary errors or flashes of brilliance. The
strong competitiveness of the English Premier League, as well as a large number of upsets in
which weaker teams prevail over stronger ones, have been major difficulties to model results.
The world's surprise when Leicester City won the Premier League in 2016 was no small thing,
but it shows that football is a game with an exceptional degree of unpredictability and this
poses considerable challenges for our efforts to solve them. Given the task is a multiclass
prediction problem in which results are classified according to three classes: home wins, road
wins and draws, this challenge has been exacerbated. Notably, draws occur less frequently
than wins or losses, which introduces an imbalance that complicates accurate prediction,
making it a more challenging problem than a binary classification (winning or not winning).
The dataset utilized in the study has undergone significant preprocessing to better fit the
predictive modelling framework. The initial dataset features can be divided into two
categories: Match facts such as full-time results, bookings, corners and shots taken etc and
betting odds from different agencies such as BET365, Betfred etc. From initial 104 features,
variables were meticulously selected and reduced to 20, based on their significance to match
outcomes. The feature reduction was crucial to enhance the modelâ€™s efficiency and focus on
the most impactful predictors.
In this project, three advanced machine learning algorithms, including Support vector
Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient were used for the predictive analysis.
These algorithms are well suited to capture the non-linear interactions between the various
features, providing a robust prediction framework. The final whistle blows with Random
Forest claiming victory in accuracy, although each model contributes unique insights into the
nuances of the beautiful game.
The prediction of football match outcomes serves multiple interests. It helps to develop
strategic plans and performance assessments when managing teams. For betting industries,
accurate predictions translate into economic gains and improved odds-setting. In addition, the
use of predictive analytics in football also opens new channels for fan engagement and
content personalization, which will enhance the overall experience and commercial value of
sports broadcasting.
